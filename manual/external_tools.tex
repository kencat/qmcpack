\chapter{External Tools}
\label{chap:external_tools}
This chapter provides some information on using QMCPACK with external tools.

\section{VTune}

Intel's VTune profiler has an API that allows program control over collection (pause/resume) and can add information to the profile data (e.g. delineating tasks).

\subsection{VTune API}

If the variable \texttt{USE\_VTUNE\_API} is set, QMCPACK will check that the
include file (\texttt{ittnotify.h}) and the library (\texttt{libittnotify.a}) can
be found.
To provide CMake with the VTune paths, add the include path to \texttt{CMAKE\_CXX\_FLAGS} and the the library path to \texttt{CMAKE\_LIBRARY\_PATH}.

An example of options to be passed to CMake
\begin{shade}
 -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-I/opt/intel/vtune_amplifier_xe/include \
 -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/intel/vtune_amplifier_xe/lib64
\end{shade}

\section{NVIDIA Tools Extensions (NVTX)}

NVIDIA's Tools Extensions (NVTX) API enables programmers to annotate their source code when used with the NVIDIA profilers.

\subsection{NVTX API}

If the variable \texttt{USE\_NVTX\_API} is set, QMCPACK will add the library (\texttt{libnvToolsExt.so}) to the qmcpack target. To add NVTX annotations
to a function, it is necessary to include the \texttt{nvToolsExt.h} header file and then make the appropriate calls into the NVTX API. For more information
about the NVTX API, see \url{https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/profiler-users-guide/index.html#nvtx}. Any additional calls to the NVTX API should be guarded by
the \texttt{USE\_NVTX\_API} compiler define.

\subsection{Timers as Tasks}
To aid in connecting the timers in the code to the profile data, the start/stop of
timers will be recorded as a task if \texttt{USE\_VTUNE\_TASKS} is set.

In addition to compiling with \texttt{USE\_VTUNE\_TASKS}, an option needs to be set at runtime to collect the task API data.
In the GUI, select the checkbox labeled "Analyze user tasks" when setting up the analysis type.
For the command line, set the \texttt{enable-user-tasks} knob to \texttt{true}. For example,
\begin{shade}
amplxe-cl -collect hotspots -knob enable-user-tasks=true ...
\end{shade}

Collection with the timers set at "fine" can generate too much task data in the profile.
Collection with the timers at "medium" collects a more reasonable amount of task data.
